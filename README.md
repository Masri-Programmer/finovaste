Developer: # Occasion and Fundraising Types Overview

There will be several types of listings:

- **Private Occasions**

## Details and Purposes

All types serve the same core purpose: enabling fundraising and donations. Here’s an explanation of each type:

### 1. Private Occasion

- Used to collect donations from anyone who has the link.

### 2. Charity Action

- Listings for direct purchases or auction bids.
- Funds raised through charity actions can be transferred to a donation campaign.

### 3. Donation Campaign
